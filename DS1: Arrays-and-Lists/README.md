Two basic type of arrays:

1) Python Lists
  * plist = [3, 8, 2, 5, 1, 7, 9]
  * Runtime:
    * Search: O(n)
    * Insert: O(n), prepend: O(n), append: O(1)
    * Delete: O(n), .pop(0): O(n), .pop(): O(1)
    * Retrieval: O(1)
    * Swap: O(1)
    * Reversal: O(n)
  * Space complexicity can be constant for each of the operations above.

2) Linked Lists
  * Each node mush have two methods:
    * value: indicating the value at the node
    * next: pointing to the next node
  * Runtime and Space
    * Search
    * Insert
    * Delete
    * Retrieval
    * Swap
    * Reversal
